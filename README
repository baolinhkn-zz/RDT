We designed our implementation together, including packet header design decisions.
We both shared the work evenly at the beginning of the project, taking turns to work on the
client and server code up until the point where we needed to implement the sliding window.
Baolinh worked on and designed the sliding window protocol while Katie worked on the design
and implementation of the time-out retransmission. We both think that the work was shared
evenly. While working on both of these parts, we would consult each other for design
decisions and for debugging.
